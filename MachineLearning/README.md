# Machine Learning

This folder utilizes the [machine learning package](https://github.com/Ziad-Attia/Machine-Learning-Package) developed by Colgate University students.

## How to use

```cd``` into this folder, and run main.py where you can enter your file name, specify the dependent variable, and configure the predictive models. 
In addition, all the functions in the package are provided with detailed reference for easy navigation.

## Prerequisites
Beside the Anaconda package, these libraries may be needed (install manually):
* imblearn
* pyreadstat
* statistics
* statsmodels.api
* xlsxwriter
* openpyxl
* glob
* ReliefF
* xgboost

You can install these libraries by running the "conda install -c conda-forge" or "pip install -U" commands followed by the name of the library in the command line for Windows/MacOs, and "conda install -c conda-forge" or "pip3 install -U" for Linux.

Refer to the [Anaconda docs](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on how to install the Anaconda package.
