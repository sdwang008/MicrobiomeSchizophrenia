# Differential Abundance

Similarly to diversity analysis, the analysis portion is done in QIIME 2, but graphing is done in [differential.py](differential.py). 

Refer to QIIME 2's [tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/#differential-abundance-testing-with-ancom) for differential abundance testing with ANCOM. [Commands](qiime2/Commands.md) is also available for reference. 

## Graphing
After running qimme composition ancom and obtaining the .qzv visualization, put it into [QIIME view](view.qiime2.org) and "download as TSV". This is the genus.tsv that is used for graphing.
